You need to build a Figma layout in React or Next.Js. The layout should be responsive, with two versions of the interface: for desktop and phone. You should check the quality of website display on all popular screen sizes. The header should be fixed in the window. On the mobile version, make a functioning burger menu at your discretion. Hover effects (and other effects, animations, etc.) should be done at your discretion: in the way you like best (if you think it is necessary).
